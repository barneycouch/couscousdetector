#Jeeves, the inframous Couscous detector.

##Introduction
Nobody likes couscous, so we built this to email us when it's tragically on the menu. By popular demand it'll tell you when other horrible dishes are available.

##Usage

`couscous_mk2.py` scrapes the hall menu for our hated foods, provided as an argument.

`receive_email.py` and `send_email.py` check our inbox for new subscribers and provide and alternate (not currently used) way to send out the email alerts, respectively.
